# Tofi Novak - Developer & Musician Portfolio

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal website, a digital space where I blend my professional life as a developer with my passion for music. This project is built using React, showcasing my development work, musical endeavors, and a bit more about who I am beyond the code.

## About The Project

This website serves as a portfolio where visitors can explore my projects as a software developer and my creative output as a musician. It's designed to be interactive and responsive, reflecting both my technical skills and artistic sensibilities.

### Built With

- **React.js** - The web framework used for building the user interface.
- **Sass/SCSS** - For styling, ensuring the site is visually appealing and responsive.
- **Framer Motion** - Utilized for animations to make the site more dynamic and engaging.

## Future Deployment

The site will be deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com), leveraging its seamless integration with GitHub for continuous deployment.

## Features

- **Professional Portfolio:** Showcasing my projects, contributions, and the technologies I work with.
- **Music Portfolio:** A section dedicated to my music, including compositions, performances, and any music-related projects.
- **Contact Form:** For potential clients, collaborators, or fans to get in touch with me.

## Why React and Netlify?

React allows me to create a dynamic and stateful experience for users, making the website not just a portfolio but an interactive web application. Netlify is chosen for its ease of use, automatic SSL, and continuous deployment features, making the process of publishing updates straightforward and secure.

## What's Next?

As this project evolves, I plan to integrate more features such as a live music player, a more extensive blog with categories and tags, and a project showcase with detailed case studies.

## Get In Touch

Whether you're interested in collaborating on a project, learning more about my music, or just saying hi, I'd love to hear from you. The website includes a contact form, or you can directly reach out to me via [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername).

Thank you for visiting my repository, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
